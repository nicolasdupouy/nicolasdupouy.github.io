# How to
## Serve the site locally
Build the site and make it available on a local server (http://localhost:4000):

    bundle exec jekyll serve

Pass the `--livereload` option to serve to automatically refresh the page with each change you make to the source files:

    bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
